1. **NPM Project Setup**

  - First i created a repo and cloned it done then i realised in nuxt framework it is already git repo 
    so i deleted it and started over with:

  - npm setup using
    npm init nuxt-app <project-name>
  - This step created bunch of files including README.md
  so i edited it and redoing it
